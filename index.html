       <p>This is the basic painting method that’s been used for decades. Start with a coloured undercoat, add shading, then pick out the raised detail with a lighter colour. This takes the most time and practice, but gets you great results.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><b>Step 1:</b> Undercoat A solid undercoat is the foundation upon which your brilliant paint scheme is built. Coloured undercoats also save you loads of time.</li>
           <li><b>Step 2:</b> Apply Your Base Colours Give each section of your model a strong colour called a base coat. Thin your paints with water to achieve a smooth, consistent finish.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Add a Shade Darken down the nooks and crannies with specially formulated Shade paints. Either apply them directly to the recesses or spread them across a surface for smooth transitions.</li>
             <li><b>Step 4:</b> Paint the Base Now it’s time to add some texture and colour to the base of your miniature. This helps to finish the model off and tie your army together.</li>
              <li><b>Step 5:</b> Ready for Battle That’s it! An army painted to this standard looks fantastic on the tabletop. Your units are prepared to take on whatever your opponent throws at them.</li>

       <p>Contrast paints offer the fastest way to get your models painted up to a Battle Ready standard. Start with a light undercoat, then add specialised paint that applies both a strong colour and shading in the recesses at once.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><b>Step 1:</b> Undercoat
           A smooth, light undercoat is essential for the Contrast method. It allows the specially formulated paints to work their magic.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 2:</b> Apply Your Base Colours
            Contrast paints are formulated to speed up the painting process, combining a vibrant base colour and shading in one application.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 3:</b> Paint the Base
            Now it’s time to add some texture and colour to the base of your miniature. This helps to finish the model off and tie your army together.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 4:</b> Ready for Battle
            That’s it! An army painted to this standard looks fantastic on the tabletop. Your units are prepared to take on whatever your opponent throws at them.</li>

       <p>The combined painting technique utilises the entire toolbox of Classic methods and techniques, plus Contrast paints, to achieve the best possible results. This method can also be used to create special effects, like colour-tinted metallic finishes.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><b>Step 1:</b> Undercoat 
            A solid undercoat is the foundation upon which your brilliant paint scheme is built. Coloured undercoats also save you loads of time.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 2:</b> Apply Your Base Colours
            Give each section of your model a base coat. Whether you choose light or dark colours depends on which areas use Contrast paints.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 3:</b> Add Shades and Contrast
            The Combined method blends the Classic and Contrast techniques together. Choose which areas will use Shade paints and which you’ll pick out with Contrast paints.</li>
   
           <li><b>Step 4:</b> Paint the Base
            Now it’s time to add some texture and colour to the base of your miniature. This helps to finish the model off and tie your army together.</li>
   
             <li><b>Step 5:</b> Ready for Battle
            That’s it! An army painted to this standard looks fantastic on the tabletop, prepared to take on whatever your opponent throws at them.<li>
